Just trying to figure out a way for us to share code.<br>
I don't really know how to use Git, but if nothing else, we can copy and paste.<br>
<hr>
Help_me.Rmd is R-Markdown notebook of in-class lab. <br>
ps5communal.R is R code (in progress) working on Problem Set 5. <br>
q4.csv is data set for Question 4 of Ps5. <br>
